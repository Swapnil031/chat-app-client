# Let's Chat
### A Real-Time Chat Application

**[Live Site - Share link and Chat with your friends in realtime](https://swapnil031.github.io/client/)**

This is the code repository for the project "Let's Chat" - a chat application allowing multiple users to create/join rooms and chat in realtime with their friends.
What good is a chat app without fun of using emojis in chats? So the support for emojis is enabled for chatting. 
Users can also see the current participants of the chatroom and gets notified if someone leaves or joins the room.

The app uses **[Socket.io](https://socket.io/)** - a JavaScript library that enables realtime, bi-directional and event-based communication between web clients and servers. It has two parts: a client-side library that runs in the browser, and a server-side library for Node.js.

Frontend of the app is designed mobile-responsive using **CSS** and developed in **React**. The client-side is deployed on **Github-Pages**.

**Express.js** (a Node.js framework) is used to develop the backend of the app. The server is hosted on **Heroku** - a cloud platform (PaaS) for hosting web applications.

As a beginner, I undertook and completed this project to gain a strong understanding of React, Node.js and socket programming (socket.io).
