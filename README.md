# Let's Chat
### A Real-Time Chat Application

This is the code repository for the project "Let's Chat" - a chat application allowing multiple users to create and join rooms, and chat in realtime with their friends.
What good is a chat app without fun of using emojis in chats? So the support for emojis is enabled in chatting. Users can see the current participants of the chatroom and gets notified if someone leaves or joins the room.
